1. What is a Node module?

A set of functions to include in your app. It should be self contained and execute one part of the program. 

2. What is the main difference between exports and module.exports?

It is the object returned by the `require` call. By default it is empty but can be reassigned to anything, or can have functions assigned to it directly. Using module.exports assigns functions to it directly, whereas exports is a reference to the module.exports object. 


3.Why is using exports recommended?

It is more convnient and you can still work with its properties. module.exports is reccomended when you want the object ot be a specific object type.
